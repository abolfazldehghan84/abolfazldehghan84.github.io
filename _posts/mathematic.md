Prime numbers are fascinating and play a crucial role in number theory. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, it cannot be divided evenly by any other numbers except for 1 and the number itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are all prime numbers.

Interestingly, 2 is the only even prime number, as all other even numbers are divisible by 2 and thus not prime. Prime numbers are considered the "building blocks" of all numbers, because every number greater than 1 can be factored into a product of primes, a concept known as the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

Prime numbers are not only important in mathematics but also have applications in fields like cryptography, where they are used to secure digital communication.
